# Full-stack Developer Course

> **NOTE**
> This is a work in progress. As lessons are worked through with the actual student, each lesson will be updated. Be aware of this if you are tempted to work ahead of the classes.

Lessons for full-stack development: from setting up your environment, through developing a front-end and a backend, to deploying it live.

Each lesson is intended to be about an hour of interactive tutoring between a student and a mentor. Each lesson has homework with linked references.

The ultimate goal is to build working experience with some of the most commonly used tools and to prepare the student for a typical software developer role in the industry; and to fill in some of the gaps often left in typical college classes. There is no rubric or grading guide, because the real measure of success is how prepared the student is for employment.

## Ground Rules and Tips for the Student

- You will need a GitHub account for the tutorial repository that will have your notes and code
- You may use AI and search engines for the course work, but only in "Ask" mode to ensure that you are learning the concepts. Avoid using AI to write code.
- You may copy and paste from the lessons and/or search/AI results, but make sure you understand what you are pasting
- You may use AI or search engines to find additional resources or summarize the resources, as necessary
- You will learn a lot doing the homework exercises. It is strongly recommended you at least attempt to do them and ask about them during the next lesson
